% Function description:
% This function generates the measurements according to the generated
% channel and sensing matrix.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input arguments:
% Sensing_Matrix: a structure array that groups related parameters sensing
% matrix, please refer to Generate_Sensing_Matrix.m for details of its
% fields.
% SNR: the SNR before beam training in dB.
% H: a structure array that groups related parameters on mmWave channel.
% Add_Noise_Flag: whether the Gaussian noise is introduced in the Rx side.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Output arguments:
% measurements: a structure array that groups related parameters on the 
% received measurements with different transformations. 
% noise_power: the power of noise calculated according to SNR.
