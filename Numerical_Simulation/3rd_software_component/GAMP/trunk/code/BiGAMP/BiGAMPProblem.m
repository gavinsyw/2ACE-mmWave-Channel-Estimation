        %Problem dimensions. While these parameters may be computable in
        %some cases, for simplicity/generality, BiG-AMP requires that they
        %be set explicitly. The observation matrix is MxL, and N is the
        %inner dimension of the matrix mulitply, e.g. the rank in a matrix
        %completion problem. The value of N may be overriden by the EM
        %codes when doing rank learning, but it must be provided for
        %low-level BiG-AMP routines
